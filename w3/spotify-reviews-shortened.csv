Review,Rating
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently,1
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,1
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",1
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,1
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?",1
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,1
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it,1
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.,1
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",1
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",1
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in,1
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds,1
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",1
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.,1
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,1
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,1
Very unuser friendly as compared to ipad and pc,1
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,1
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",1
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.,1
"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",1
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon.",1
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one.",1
It always stuck at black screen,1
I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.,1
Please turn off shuffle play!!!,1
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.",1
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$× u,1
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off",1
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.",1
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little,1
it does'nt let you choose your songs,1
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",1
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",1
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.,1
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",1
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend.",1
Sometimes it is not working,1
Very annoying and disturbing,1
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond,1
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",1
"Worst app for music,so many ads.",1
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay.",1
Stopped working this morning for some reason.,1
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,1
I cant open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,1
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,1
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,1
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.",1
So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,1
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,1
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",1
"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed",1
can't like anymore songs,1
"Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?",1
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",1
To many advertisements are there,1
Too much add its to irritating,1
"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app",1
Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all,1
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.,1
It just open and crashes,1
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc.",1
"I have deleted the app to reinstall it and now it will not launch anymore!! Have done the clear caches, clear data and force stopping, restarted my phone and reinstalling the app but none of them works.😭 I have a premium.accnt and now I cannot even access it ! It gets stuck to the logo opening😐",1
Customer Service is terrible. They don't answer emails back. No customer service phone number. No way to cancel subscription. Total Garbage. No help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.,1
I never seen this type of app it's worst app The app is not at all opening from first i didn't listen even one song also Pls solve this problem Spotify 👍🏻,1
WHEN I GO TO MY MUSIC IT KEEPS PUTING MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AND MUSIC THAT ARE NOT IN MY PLAYLIST LIKE FIX IT,1
I bought 1day premium pack and still getting ads. Whats the point of spending money on premium?,1
Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra,1
"So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube.",1
"WAY too many ads, and it's always the same annoying 3. Ffs",1
"App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.👍",1
I hate Spotify it won't let me choose what I want type of music it sucksssss I hate I hate it I hate it!!!!! ;,1
That's too much. Why would I use a music app that doesn't allow me to choose the tracks I wanna play? I'm done with Spotify.,1
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app",1
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!",1
"Spotify as a platform is great. But the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",1
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select,1
Downgrading to one star. Enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.,1
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,1
"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.",1
There is no search option for song.,1
It will open but I'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo,1
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",1
The app won't show the playlist I want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. Note this has been happening to me for months,1
"Too many ads. It says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.",1
"Since the last update, my Spotify has been pausing frequently. It's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. Please fix it.",1
Apple music is worse. But better.,1
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,1
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid",1
It lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.,1
"App crashes, no now playing information. If it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",1
Podcasts aren't available in my area. So annoying.,1
Too many commercials. Limited to skipping songs in playlist,1
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",1
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",1
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",1
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,1
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",1
Re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. Just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. It's more of an issue because I'm paying for premium and I can't even use it! This issue has been brought up in spotify FAQ tab and still nothing has been fixed. Very disappointed. Had to download pandora in the meantime.,1
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime.",2
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please",2
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline,2
Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.,2
"My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen",2
"Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down.",2
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix.",2
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️",2
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",2
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,2
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",2
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,2
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",2
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.",2
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.,2
When I put my songs on random like 2k songs. It always seems the same ones play. Been like this for a while,2
I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.,2
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.,2
"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us. Id rather pay for tidal. 2022 UPDATE: switched to youtube music my life is so much better 😻😻",2
Select a song and get something else Ask for RHCP and get Limp Bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.,2
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,2
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.",2
"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! 😵 I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.",2
"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",2
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",2
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",2
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",2
I love this app but I had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime I open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working,2
Would be great if it actually worked. I'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.,2
It's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me Lil Tentacion 6ix rich,2
Been using spotify for ooo 6 or 7 years... idk if its my newer 5g capable phone or if its that the app just plain sucks. But it does suck. Currently trying to play music over wifi and its saying i dont have an internet connection 🙃,2
For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?,2
"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.",2
"Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements",2
"Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. Function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!",2
"Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",2
"The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.",2
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,2
I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,2
Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,2
Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,2
Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,2
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",2
"I prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",2
"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",2
"An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",2
There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,2
"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",2
It gives me a different song instead of playing what I wanted.,2
Add ability to better control volume when playing to Alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices. Stop paying for Joe Rogans misinformation.,2
"I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",2
"After the update, Spotify doesn't load. It is stuck on the logo. I hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. Thank you.",2
Whenever I hear an ad on Spotify I vow I will never use that product,2
"Hello I'm currently having an issue where I couldn't log into my spotify. I don't even know what the problem is but the screen become all black whenever I open the Spotify app. I enjoy using Spotify so much and I open it everyday. I even subscribe to the premium plan. However, now I cannot use this Spotify and I chose to use the Lite version. PLEASE fix this problem for me :'(",2
You cant so alot on ur phone i was trying to listen to my favorites and it wouldnt let me u can also not go back to the previous song,2
Great UI so far,2
So manyyyy ads 😐😐,2
"App stability is getting worse, happens across multiple devices very frustrating.",2
I logged out of my account now when i open it it stays on the loading screen my wifi isnt even the issue bcs spotify lite works good,2
"I like Spotify but when I use the app it tells me I have no play lists and all the play lists have nothing on them but when I use Spotify on the website I have 2 play lists and there is play lists, why is that?",2
Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.,2
"I love it on my Xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a Playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.",2
Why are literally all of your ads 3x louder than the songs stop,2
"Why this app getting worse! Songs playing and I can't see the player. I can't stop, skip, or do anything. Please fix it.",2
"Good selection, not so good app.",2
"Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....",2
"What's happened? I've been using Spotify for years with no problems. But now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so I can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. This app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality I feel I'm getting a poor deal.",2
"I will only rate 5 if you include option ""Set Music As"" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",2
All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.,2
Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to,2
"I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",2
"Nothing. After I registered and pay premium mini I can't play or add, open profile of my account. How it this even possible? Plus daily mox from Spotify aslo marked as empty",2
Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify yo listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but the Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!,2
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",2
"This is probably just a personal experience, but I've reinstalled the app three times, restarted my phone, and cleared the cache twice but the app won't work. It will open and just show me the logo. I'm not even given the option to sign in.",2
"I got Spotify premium but why can't I click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. Plz fix its annoying",2
"Play bar disappears and you cannot skip or pause playing episode, only way it comes back is with a force close.",2
"You guys are making this app worst day by day. You need to understand what the users demand. Just don't think about your so called business. For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?",2
My music keeps stopping for no reason. The web player for computers is way better than the app.,2
"I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",2
Love the app when it's working. I'm paying 10 bucks a month for something to crash every 15 min and I've been waiting for over a month for it to be fixed and it's not the app timer cause I checked. If it's not fixed soon I'll find and pay for another service cause dealing with this for 10 hours a day while I'm at work is ridiculous.,2
"Great when it works, but crashes 30% of the time I try to use it, need to restart my phone just to get it to work again.",2
"I've seen worse UI and UX work on other apps, but not many.",2
It's won't shuffle the songs I have in my library or my liked songs. Since the update it won't shuffle the songs.,2
"Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",2
Usually my go-to app for music but it won't stay open on my pixel 6. I've had to reinstall twice in 2 days.,2
"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",2
"couldve been a good app if it werent so restricting. its decent in windows, but in mobile? god, this app is the worst. too much lag, needs premium for everything, and plays random songs you dont put in your playlist. you cant loop a song in mobile either.",2
I didn't like/ I don't like the automatic update! & now (without premium) how to one song on repeat?! This new update/new version 8.7.44.968 is Sucks!😡,2
"7/7/22 - The app had been working fine for a while, but is now suffering from the Samsung/Android issue. The playing now bar doesn't show up and the app stops playing randomly in the middle of songs and podcasts. 1/13/21 ‐ I've been using Spotify for about a year now (with a paid account) but recently the app has stopped playing anything. Will definitely cancel my service and uninstall if it continues.",2
After last update i can't forward podcasts via Bluetooth or on mobile app,2
"Unless you plan on getting a subscription, don't bother. I had to listen to 2 minutes worth of ads after every 3 songs.",2
Great quality sound. Many problems with app.,2
"When I play my fave song, then the other song will play",2
"The songs will not show in created playlists, only the artists. Also won't work with searching. Was fine on my tablet but just installed it on my new phone for convenience and was very disappointed.",2
I'm rating this 2 stars whenever I keep skipping the song that is NOT in my playlist its still keeps letting me listen to another song that isn't in my playlist its quite annoying.. It's just I can't buy the premium but I want to listen to my own playlist so please fix it.,2
"I used to love this app. It was the only place I got my podcasts and music but recently it either stops whenever it wants to or it won't stop without me uninstalling it. It also starts to play a playlist then plays a random song not on any of my playlists?!?! I have a premium account and am seriously thinking about cancelling it, it annoys me so much! Sort the problems Spotify!!! It can't just be me?!?!",2
"Has been a great app, but recently it's been glitchy AF. Even very simple tasks like pausing what I'm listening to, has been too much for it 😑",2
It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Don't even get me started on all the issue with Google maps app integration which makes for unsafe driving! Please contact me for more info!,2
The problem is that I'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your Playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and I've spent an hour deleting music off my Play list that I didn't even add and after I finished they added more songs so basically what I'm saying is is that I can't even listen to the songs I like when using this app,2
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,3
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",3
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..,3
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo",3
No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.,3
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars,3
Too much and too long ads.,3
"Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example.",3
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",3
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",3
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,3
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,3
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes,3
"It's a good application. When I'm searching for peace by listening song I can find it here.but I think it needs some improvements.. such as shuffle on off, playlist change,and many more.",3
Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,3
"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",3
No super awesome on android,3
"PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report.",3
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashes😕. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite version😐. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite version😧",3
Every time I play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. It gives me some random song I haven't heard of before or even want to hear. For example I was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. It went to someone like drake,3
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,3
"I like it I still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like I pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but I like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board",3
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",3
"I use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where I can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause I have to close the app. When it works, it is a good app.",3
I love this app and I'm freaking out because I accidentally logged myself out of my account and when I went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... Ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,3
"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem",3
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,3
"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.",3
"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.",3
Music is stopping out of no where n I'm starting to get more annoyed about it,3
"Nice app, but when your free trial is over, the quality really goes down, if i search a song it gives me some random person's playlist, and i can't skip to the song i like. Nice app, but only the premium version.",3
"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",3
"A great resource for music and podcasts, BUT constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to stream - need to have a new episodes feed that works. I'm paying for this! You need a widget that works, and to fix all the issues with Android auto.",3
The listening experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium member FYI,3
"I love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. I'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help...",3
It's a great app but I'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. If it's my phone or the app itself,3
"Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card.",3
"Usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as I open it. I've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open.",3
Worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song,3
"This is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, PC and Mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads.",3
I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,3
The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.,3
I am a die hard spotify fan... but with the new update. I can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until I forcibly close it. Kinda sucks.,3
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",3
"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",3
Every time i want to listen to my fave songs i can listen to a few but after like 5 songs it changes to a totally other song,3
When are they going to fix the broken dowload/offline working of spotify.,3
Other music apps have an offline feature where it allows you to download some certain music for free but it's otherwise here .,3
"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",3
Great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,3
"It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch",3
Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?,3
App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,3
I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,3
"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",3
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,3
Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.,3
It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stoped using it,3
"Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",3
Recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. Often I have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.,3
Application isn't working with wifi,3
"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",3
"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",3
Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,3
"Love the app, always have. However, it's been nothing but issues recently. The ""now playing"" info doesn't show. So I can't pause or skip music. It also stops randomly and I have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since I can't just continue with no ""now playing"" bar.",3
Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,3
Same songs keep repeating,3
Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,3
Randomly stops playing and doesn't show the controls at the top bar. Very glitchy in the last year,3
"Please change back the old insta story design, the new bold font design is so ugly. At least let us choose what design we want when sharing to insta story.",3
"This last update completely destroyed the app. Why do you keep adding pointless things that aren't needed? It's breaking the foundation of the app. When I play music now, it doesn't show up at the bottom of the screen or on my lock screen, it's like I never even played the song. And then after 10 minutes it just cuts out for no reason and I have to go back to the app. I can't even listen to music for no reason. Sort it out",3
My player stopped working with the app I'll play a podcast and it stopped please fix asap,3
Can't figure out how to sign in to my family plan and merge both Spotify's,3
Well I loved it at 1st... Then after trouble I had to contact you guys... 1 st few times was good then the last few times I was wondering if the folks I was talking to even had a clue... after being told twice I would have to manually download my whole list again I threatened to Terminate... Then decided to try one more time and was able to get all my songs back with ZERO HELP FROM YOUR TECH SUPPORT... I'm still in the fence about leaving...,3
The app has been VERY glitchy the last 2 days. A developer needs to look at it.,3
Great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. But the fact that I can't listen to the song I want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. If you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.,3
"This app is a must but the only thing I don't like it because there's too much of add. After playing one or two music ,there you can hear the sound of the add",3
"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",3
Spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my One plus 9R device. Requesting team to look into the same. It's more guess because of the recent OS update by one plus,3
"Recently I've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. I normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. My most annoying issue though is that I can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. It kinda sucks right now considering I pay for premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10",3
"Still buggy but functional. I still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. Beyond that, it's alright. Shuffle doesn't work properly. Will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement",3
"I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",3
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,3
I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. Its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. Please fix it,3
I enjoy listening to my music in Spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your songs and get an ad interruption durning a song other wise I would've rate a 5 but I give you 3 rating it could be better,3
It was a ok app didn't have it that long was use to pandora music playing guess I will try it again some day,3
Easy to use enyable and entertainable,3
Ever time I try to listen to a certain song it always play something different.,3
"Love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. Meaning I can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/",3
"Love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.",3
"I would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in tht(ex.korean,telugu) language only i mean english too and I took subcription of a week and it just wont let me see the download option😓",3
"Has been bugging out recently. Won't show what I'm playing, will randomly stop, isn't keeping track of playlists",3
It's pretty cool I like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still I like it,3
"Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating.",3
Why can't I use the app for a few days now? I tried uninstalling installing. Even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. I need to stream.,3
There is some bug that does not allow the songs to be played in the order it shows in the playlist. Please fix this,3
I have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,3
"it is a great app but it has a skip limit time now and it does not have the shuffle button anymore it does it automatically and if I click on a song it takes me to a different song that is not the one I chose, I will like to listen to my playlist in pieces 😤",3
"It's a good app, but I don't like how you have to get premium to unshuffle your playlists.",3
"The app start to crash very often, at this point it doesn't start anymore.",3
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this.",4
His voice is so sweet and hearable,4
An amazing music experience,4
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme,4
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.,4
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.,4
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now,4
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,4
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",4
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️",4
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.,4
I love to hear Ads 😌❤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads 😔....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great App🙏😊,4
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate.",4
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,4
I love Spotify just wish I can download music,4
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp),4
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️",4
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,4
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",4
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,4
All good but I don't like ads too much ads,4
"It’s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",4
Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.,4
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,4
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,4
It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!,4
"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",4
Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.,4
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,4
"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem.",4
"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",4
Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users,4
amazing app just a decent amount of adds,4
Always had Spotify on my computer and now got it on my phone great to use doesn't take to long to open great .,4
I wish it would cycle through all the songs in a play list before playing a song I just herd,4
Generally good. Lots of music i like. A few missing things. Don't want suggestions fir Kanye etc. Why doesn't it suggest more appropriate tunes?,4
The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,4
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,4
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,4
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.",4
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,4
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,4
"The app works really well but i hope you change the Romanised lyrics of tamil into original. The Romanised lyrics of tamil has alot spelling mistakes , so hope you change that into original",4
I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,4
It bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.,4
"So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the",4
Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.,4
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",4
The main problem for me it's the absence of Belarusian language. It would be great to use the app in my lang,4
So far so good but hard to control on my car system but I'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..👍🏽,4
"I have had this app a short while, I really like it a lot, I can't wait to have all my music where I want. I recommend you. Thankyou. Di",4
"def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also community tab for mobile pls !!",4
"Good algorithm, shame the app pays for good quality",4
Good but too much ads,4
If offline mode was available for the normal version of Spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs,4
For some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever I try to listen to my playlist,4
Great app but should reduce ads,4
Great but slows down my phone.,4
The ads are ridiculous. Ya I know you can pay for the app and the ads go away but I don't have extra money for a subscription,4
"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English. We hear many songs in many different Indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like Tamil,Telugu,etc I am Marathi so I can I read English, Marathi,Hindi not any other Indian languages So please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!",4
Because this app have so many ads and also some songs are not.,4
"It provides best music quality than any other app, as it is more essential for good music experience. It has millions of songs and podcasts. So just enjoy listening music on Spotify. 😉☺",4
Enjoy listening to my favourite old songs,4
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",4
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",4
So much good music app good performance and my favourite song is Sigma,4
The ads are disturbing but the overall experience is nice,4
"I found this app was intresting. Easy to use... Urge to improve: I use lyrics as full screen, then i switched on another app. When songs changed, i switched back. Lyrics's screen turn to error, keep showing prev lyric.",4
Very good app all genres and era of music Gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,4
Lots of good music but lots of adds,4
The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.😁😊👌🤌🤟👍,4
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better",4
Everything's fine about Spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. Please improve shuffle option,4
The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,4
Its a good app for music but the ads 😅 they are very annoying 😡 but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,4
"Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",4
"Nice apps, but too expensive to get the premium",4
Love the app Like my choices to listening to my favorites,4
THIS IS THE BEST STREAMING APP EVER tho before when I downloaded Spotify and I played a song it plays another song it was actually dumb Which made me move to yt but I came back again and it was gone :D so mabey this problem still exists for others so I would recommend trying to fix that,4
"it was good, but i think spotify duo package is kinda useless, well i meant the terms to lived in the same house kinda stupid for duo, well of course it make sense for family but duo? not every couple lived or always lived in the same house.",4
Easy to navigate & share between devices. But it doesn't always play videos,4
This app is really good but sometimes there are not lyrics :(,4
Amazing app just wish we could go download the song is without fear premium,4
"Usually love Spotify, but for as long as I can remember the app randomly stops playing a song then anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes I will start playing again... Does this at least 5-10 times per song.... Infuriating... Especially when you're having a sing along in the car and the song randomly stops playing... And you're not a great singer.... Please fix!",4
Spotify is the best app i ever used i felt that spotify is connect with my soul and heart what ever my mood is spotify play that type of songs for me😍 i love spotify❤,4
Good for listening on headphones!,4
I would love an option to rename playlists on android mobile,4
Great app! I can listen to deftones sure! Only problem which has just occurred for some reason is where it keeps playing random songs? Like I'm trying to play my Playlist and then after the top first song it plays another song that was never added to my liked songs? Never played it on spotify either. If this problem can be fixed please! And I mean please fix this!!,4
"I have the premium version, I like it but when I'm conecting my JBL speaker the sound is interrupted and it's not great sounding",4
"I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I have another app open Spotify randomly stops, making me have to go to the app to get my music back, and whatever song it was on, even if it almost done, restarts. Other then that, spotify is great for listening to music, or podcasts!",4
Nice relaxing app that keeps improving over time,4
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well.",4
Good but without premium there is a lot of ads and I can't listen to the song I want,4
"I really enjoy using this app, but I do have one suggestion. I'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. It'd make it much easier to look through my library. Still though, wonderful to use! <3",4
"Overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. However the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, I can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.",4
Spotify is a good music app not that many adds and I would really recommend it to my friends.,4
I like the podcasts and I used to listen to audio books on you tube but I think I'll keep listening to spotify,4
When I clicked on the songs I wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol I still recommend it to a lot of people,4
"Okay, I have a membership so I don't have any ads but my Spotify app on my phone wasn't working well. It wasn't showing something was playing and would stop in the middle of something.",4
Seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade And stop complaining!!,4
